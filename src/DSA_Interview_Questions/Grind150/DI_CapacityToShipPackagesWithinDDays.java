     * A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within days days.
     * The ith package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i].
     * Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights).
     * We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
     * Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within days days.
     * <p>
     * Example 1:
     * Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], days = 5
     * Output: 15
     * Explanation: A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
     * 1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
     * 2nd day: 6, 7
     * 3rd day: 8
     * 4th day: 9
     * 5th day: 10
     * Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed.
     * <p>
     * Example 2:
     * Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], days = 3
     * Output: 6
     * Explanation: A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
     * 1st day: 3, 2
     * 2nd day: 2, 4
     * 3rd day: 1, 4
     * <p>
     * Example 3:
     * Input: weights = [1,2,3,1,1], days = 4
     * Output: 3
     * Explanation:
     * 1st day: 1
     * 2nd day: 2
     * 3rd day: 3
     * 4th day: 1, 1
     * <p>
     * Constraints:
     * 1 <= days <= weights.length <= 5 * 104
     * 1 <= weights[i] <= 500
